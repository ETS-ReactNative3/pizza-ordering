## Guide
- Each Developers creates a [git](https://git-scm.com/docs) branch according to his name (nguyenvana).
- When Developer develops a new feature. He should branch off from his branch prefix with his first name (ex: **feature/a-signin**) and create a [pull request](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/create-a-pull-request-945541466.html) to merge back to his branch. So that He has a chance to review his code again or ask other developers with their views.
- Commit's convention [KARMA](http://karma-runner.github.io/3.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html)
